# About
Sklearn is a popular machine-learning library (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn). It has a large code base with hundreds of thousands of lines of code.` The primary target of this project is to make sklearn-mini with many important functionalities of sklearn, and remain under 1000 lines of code.` This would make the library very usable and readable.
